# ========================= Syntax and Comments =========================
# 1- What is Syntax?
# ---> The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that 
#      defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted 
#      (by both the runtime system and by human readers).
# ---> print()
print("Hello Python!")
# console.log("Hello Python!")
print("=" * 75)

# ---> Python uses something called indentation.
if 10 == 20:
    print("Hello Python!")
else:
    print("Hello Programming!")
print("=" * 75)

# For example, in other languages:
# if (10 == 10) {
#     console.log("Hello Python!");
# }

# ---> Python does not have a semicolon (;).
print("Hello Python,");
print("How are you?");
print("=" * 75)

# ---> But we use it if we write two statements in the same line.
print("Hello Python."); print("How are you?")
print("=" * 75)

# 2- What is Comment?
# ---> Comments in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by 
#      the interpreter during the execution of the program.
# print("This will NOT be printed, because it is a comment")
print("=" * 75)

# ---> Single line comments
# This is a single line comment
print("Hello Python!") # This is a single line comment
print("=" * 75)

# ---> Multiline Comments
# This will print 15,
# because it adds two numbers which are 10 and 5,
# for that the result will be 15.
print(10 + 5)
print("=" * 75)

# ---> Docstring comment
